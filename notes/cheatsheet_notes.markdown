Operators and thier properties:
    what they commute with, how they effect quantum numbers
    hamiltonians they commute with.
parity, p
charge cojugation, c
g parity, g

Hamiltonians
weak
strong
electromagnetic
gravity?

all relevant particles from pages 18 and 22
    note how the super scripts denote charge

bosons:
    all quantum number and other data like in the tables on pages 18 and 22
w+ w- and z0 bosons 
photons
gluons
gravitons

Relevant relativistic equations.
    * 4 vectors

* width is hbar times gamma (decayrate)
* hbar * c and h * c values and units.
    * 197 MeV*fm and 1240 eV*nm
